# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using K Means Clustering Algorithm.


Specific groups are identified in a Mall Customer Dataset based on their age, annual income and their spendings. 

Number of Clusters is calculated using WCSS (Within Cluster Sum of Squares). Using the "elbow method" as a cutoff point is a 
common method in mathematical optimization to choose a point where diminishing returns are no longer worth the additional cost.

K Means algorithm is implemented using sci-kit learn library.
